Hi,

This is Anirudh. I'm a software developer, husband, and a long-time Liverpool FC fan. 

The purpose of this blog is to build on things I've already discovered.

I realize I don't have a great memory, nor do I have the time to recreate everything from scratch, hence I intend to write for myself and others.

I want to create something of long-lasting value.

Thanks for reading. You can find me on Twitter - anirudhonezero.
